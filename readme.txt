This is an arcade style game that demonstrates a bunch of the GBA's features.
I wrote is as a final project, the alternative assignments were super lame =P.

There are several dependencies you'll have to track down to compile this (ARM
stuff, tools for formatting the compiled code into a GBA rom, etc). Checl the
makefile for details, and also refer to Tonc (located at
http://www.coranac.com/tonc/text/toc.htm). Tonc is a fantastic resource for GBA
development.
